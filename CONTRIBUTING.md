# Contribution Guide

Contribute to your ability for your own learning benefit. This is a project for beginner developers to get practical experience, no need to hold back.

## Get started

Fork the repo, then clone it on your machine, checkout the develop branch and start up the dev servers. Next, take a look at our [project](https://github.com/pdariusv/howdy-group-project/projects/1) to see what's left to do.

Don't struggle unnecessarily. Join us on our project slack (luciancic or pdariusv can send you an invite) and drop in on our [Tuesday meets on Howdy](https://www.joinhowdy.com/groups/5e7cde8f9007a22d5dae6c43).

## Contribution steps

1. Pick an issue and comment on it so we can assign it. Ask questions if you're not sure you can handle it, we'll almost certainly provide help and guidance.
2. Create a branch `your-feature` from `develop`. Make sure `develop` is up to date with `upstream/develop`.
3. Make your changes in your new branch.
4. Push to `origin` and open a PR against `upstream/develop`.
5. Await review. If anything's missing we'll let you know. You will also get valuable feedback.

## Git terms

* **Origin**: your forked repo on github
* **Upstream**: pdariusv's repo

## Questions/feedback

If anything's unclear leave a comment on the issues, in slack or ask us at the meets. Keep in mind most people on this project are beginners, so there's really no such thing as a "stupid question".
